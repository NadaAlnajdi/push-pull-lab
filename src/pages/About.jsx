          people help each other. In 2022, Arise acquired Classy, which enables
          nonprofit organizations to maximize their impact through a suite of
          online fundraising tools. Together, Arise and Classy are building a
          future where everyone has the ability to make a meaningful difference
          for the people, causes, and communities they care about most. Through
          our Arise platform and Classy software business, we offer innovative
